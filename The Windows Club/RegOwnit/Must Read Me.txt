RegOwnit v1.0

Take Ownership of a Registry key using Administrator, HomeUsers or the current Logged On User.

Apply Full or Read Only Permissions to a Registry Key.

I have tested on Windows 7 Home Premium x86 and had a 100% rate with every test. This does not mean this will work 100% for everyone but if you have errors or can't get application to run. Visit The Windows Club Forumsand leave Feedback.

After constantly getting annoyed at manually editing Permissions for a Registry Key I searched trying to locate an easier option and found a wonderful Command-Line based app called SetACL by Helge Klein. http://helgeklein.com/

While this gives users the ability to do alot that users weren't able to do with Registry Keys without extra effort.

RegOwnit is basically a shell to the Command-Line SetACL, giving users an easy solution without alot of know how. This does not mean there isn't much to RegOwnit, quite the opposite.

I tried my best to keep the file size to a minimum but SetACL is close to 2MB itself and there was no way to eliminate this.

RegOwnit v1.0 has been developed by Lee Whiitington for The Windows Club.

If you enjoy the application and wish to help support my work feel free to help me with a donation, which I use to further my works and help keep them free for everyone to use. This donation does not go to TheWindowsClub.com

Always backup your registry and/or create a sytem restore point first before using RegOwnit.
