Ultimate Windows Customizer was an idea from my friend Anand Khanse, site owner of www.thewindowsclub.com.

Most of the stuff included is things I have not dealt with before and as such it has taken months and I mean hard working months to put this together. 

The following are many great sites\developers I have drawn inspiration from on our quest to create a one of a kind all in one Customizing App for Windows 7 and coming, for Windows 8.
