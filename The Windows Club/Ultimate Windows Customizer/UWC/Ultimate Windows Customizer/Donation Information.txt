Donations go towards helping me Lee Whittington with future developments and are in no way affiliated with The Windows Club.

I use the donations to help maintain my computer which goes through a lot of abuse for me to do the things I do.

This also helps me know that users appreciate the hard work I put into all of the applications that I write and to know what users are interested in and what users aren't.

I will in no way push anyone to donate but greatly appreciate it if one comes. Just a poor southern boy from Alabama, lol.

If you wish to donate but don't use PayPal, you can contact me via JohnLeeWhittington@hotmail.com with the service you prefer and I will happily create an account.

Lee Whittington.
